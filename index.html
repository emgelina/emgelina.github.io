            <i>Tic-tac-toe</i> is a game played on a three by three grid by two players. The first player selects one box on the grid and plays <b>X</b>. 
            The first player must always play <b>X</b> on their turns. Player one may only play on one square per turn, but all squares claimed in previous 
            turns are held through the duration of the game. Player one's goal is to occupy three squares in a straight line or in a diagonal line before <b><i>Player 2</i></b> does.
